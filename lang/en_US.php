<h3>What does this do?</h3>
<p>IPLock filters which IP adress can log on the admin panel</p>
<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>After install, you can find IPLock under the "Site Admin" menu.
Appart from that, I hope it's self explanatory</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>IPLock adds a permission, "IPLock Management", and it should be checked if you wan't to administer IP locking.</p>
